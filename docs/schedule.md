The tutorial is on __Sunday, October 12__ starting at __09:00__ in the __Lloyd Suite__. The speakers will be available afterwards for Q&A, and questions are always welcome on the [_aeon_](/https://www.aeon-toolkit.org/) Slack (details on the website) or via email.

We will try to get all slides and accompanying code examples uploaded before the tutorial. If we are unable to, we will upload them after.
